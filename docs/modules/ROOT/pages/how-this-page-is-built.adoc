= How this page is built
Sebastian Sommerfeld <sebastian@sommerfeld.io>

This website is constructed using Antora, and all its pages originate from Asciidoc files.

== About Antora
link:https://antora.org[Antora] is a static site generator that simplifies the process of creating documentation websites. It takes content from link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest[Asciidoc] files, which are simple text documents formatted with a lightweight markup language, and turns them into a cohesive website.

These Asciidoc files aren't stored in a single place but rather exist across different repositories. All these repositories are part of the sommerfeld-io GitHub organization. That means that every repository can carry its own documentation. Antora is the tool that brings all this content together, formats it into a cohesive structure, and presents it as a unified documentation website for easy access and navigation.

This website uses Kroki.io to generate diagrams from text sources. PlantUML is mostly used with this website, although other diagram types are supported as well.
