= Our Software Development Life Cycle
Sebastian Sommerfeld <sebastian@sommerfeld.io>

CAUTION: Work in Progress ...

. Requirements
.. Write a user story or create a Todo issue (say to mitigate a CVE)
. Dev
.. clone repo / pull repo /maybe create a branch
.. when branch -> create PR
.. write code locally following TDD
.. if needed, add BDD style test cases
.. commit
... pre-commit -> run checks to avoid pipeline fails as much as possible (the simple things like linting)
... commit and push into main or branch (if a branch is used)
.. pipelines
... lint
... build
.. integrate
... if branch and pipelines green, merge into main
.. Release
.. then the release candidate is delivered

NOTE: TODO ... Create some soft of diagram. Point out that everything takes place in small iterations
