== Code Repositories
Each project is hosted within its dedicated repository on GitHub. All projects, that provide any service to www.sommerfeld.io, are part of the link:https://github.com/sommerfeld-io[sommerfeld-io GitHub organization], ensuring centralized management and fostering collaboration across our entire software ecosystem.

Normally a repository contains the whole application with all components (we do not split a single app into multiple repos). Instead we introduce component-folders. This way we can share resources like workflows or issue templates and can release the application as a whole.

Most projects follow this directory structure:

* `.devcontainer` -> This folder contains specifications for development containers. These configurations help in standardizing the development environment for consistency among team members. This is not a mandatory folder but it is recommended to use a development container.
* `.github` -> This directory houses all things related to GitHub, including workflow definitions.
* `config` -> Application configuration files reside here. These files contain settings, parameters, or environment-specific configurations necessary for the application to run.
* `docs` -> This folder uses AsciiDoc organized for Antora to manage documentation. Antora is a documentation site generator, and AsciiDoc is the markup language used to write the documentation.
* `src/main` -> Here lies the main application code. Can be structured this into subdirectories based on components (`components/<COMPONENT_NAME>`).
* `src/test` -> This directory holds test code used for testing the application. Similar to the main code, these tests can also be structured into subdirectories based on components (`components/<COMPONENT_NAME>`).

A `Dockerfile` in the project root allows building the application with all dependencies. Alternatively this Dockerfile can be placed in a component-folder (`components/<COMPONENT_NAME>`). An optional `docker-compose.yml` can be places alongside the `Dockerfile`. A `Makefile` in the project root controls dependency management and building the application.

A `pre-commit` config is present in every repositories root to run checks before committing changes. Also linter definitions are places in the project root.

== Automated Pipelines with GitHub Actions Workflows
The GitHub Actions workflows within this repository adhere to a standardized approach tailored for the link:https://github.com/sommerfeld-io[Sommerfeld.io GitHub organization]. These workflows serve as a blueprint, showcasing best practices and a consistent structure that other projects can leverage and adapt. While maintaining this standardized framework, individual projects within the Sommerfeld.io organization might diverge in certain details to accommodate their unique requirements or specific workflows.

This project is equipped with linter definitions, serving as a foundational standard for other repositories within the organization. These linter definitions establish a baseline coding style and quality standard that other projects can adopt and build upon. This serves as a valuable resource for other repositories within the organization, allowing them to maintain a cohesive codebase and adhere to best practices in coding standards.

Most repositories utilize these workflows in one form or another:

* Build (is releasable) -> GitHub Actions workflow for the website module that builds the app and runs automated tests.
* Generate Docs -> GitHub Actions workflow that generates Asciidoc documentation based on source code from this repo and updates the projects README file.
* Housekeeping: Issues + PRs -> GitHub Actions workflow handles the automatic assignment of newly created issues and pull requests.
* Housekeeping: Labels -> GitHub Actions workflow that ensures all mandatory labels are present for a repo and all obsolete labels are removed.
* Deploy + Release -> GitHub Actions to create a new release of this software project.

== Artifact Repositories
DockerHub serves as our only artifact repository for storing and distributing software, providing a reliable and efficient solution for containerized components. Since we publish everything as Docker images, there is no need for any other artifact repository.

== Manage Projects and Todos
We utilize GitHub's project feature extensively within the link:https://github.com/sommerfeld-io[sommerfeld-io organization] to effectively manage user stories, tasks, risks, security issues, and all other types of todos across our projects. By leveraging this feature, we centralize and streamline our project management efforts, enabling efficient collaboration, tracking, and progress monitoring for all initiatives.

== Runtime environments
Our software operates within containers. This configuration is true for all stages, encompassing both production and various testing environments. By utilizing containers, we ensure consistent deployment and scalability throughout the whole lifecycle.

Note that the sizing of production and test stages may differ. While production environments typically require dedicated resources and consistent availability, test environments are designed to be flexible and on-demand. Test environments may not be continuously running but can be provisioned as needed to perform specific tests or validations. This approach allows us to optimize resource utilization and cost-effectiveness while ensuring efficient and reliable testing processes throughout the development lifecycle.
