Docker images follow a tagging convention based on semantic versioning. Each stable version of an image is tagged with a specific semantic version (e.g. `:v0.2.0`), while the `:latest` tag always points to the most recent stable version.

Unstable pre-release versions are marked with a suffix (`-alpha.0`, `-beta.1`). These versions usually are used for development, testing, review and approval purposes. These versions are not recommended for production use. `:latest` never points to an unstable pre-release.

Images also have an `:rc` tag, which contains the most recent feature set from the `main` branch. This feature set is not yet released, but based on our approach is in a releasable state. Other Branches do not publish their own image versions to DockerHub.
