== About the UI Bundle
This project also contains the Antora UI bundle sources. This UI bundle represents the design for all Antora-based pages of https://www.sommerfeld.io[www.sommerfeld.io].

The UI bundle is built alongside the whole website ensuring that the latest UI bundle is used for www.sommerfeld.io. This way there is no need to download the UI bundle from anywhere because it is part of the Docker image which serves the website.

Still a download is possible because the UI bundle is published as a zip-File with each GitHub release. This way other projects can use this UI bundle as well.
