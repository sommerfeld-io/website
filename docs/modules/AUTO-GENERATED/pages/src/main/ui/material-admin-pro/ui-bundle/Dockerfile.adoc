= Dockerfile

Local development image which provides the preview for the UI bundle.

== Overview

This Dockerfile is used for local development purposes only. Despite being
build and tested via a GitHub Actions workflow, it is never published to DockerHub. It
remains confined to local usage. This particular Dockerfile is providing the preview for
the UI bundle, enabling convenient development by running `gulp preview`.

The reason for not simply copying the UI bundle sources directly into the container is
because this method wouldn't allow the preview to update based on changes made to the
source files. Instead, by mounting a volume, the container can dynamically reflect any
modifications made to the source files without needing to be rebuilt or restarted. This
live synchronization between the host and container filesystems enables real-time updates,
crucial for rendering an accurate preview based on the latest changes in the source code.

=== Prerequisites

This image has been developed and tested with Docker version 24.0.7 on top of Ubuntu 23.10.

=== Unprivileged user

This Dockerfile ensures that the container doesn't run as the default root user but rather switches to a user named "sebastian." This change is crucial to prevent permission conflicts between the container and the host filesystem
