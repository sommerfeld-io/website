= docker-compose.yml

Docker Compose configuration to build and start all Docker containers required for local development.

== Overview

This Docker Compose configuration serves the purpose of building and starting all
the essential Docker containers required to facilitate the local development of both the website
and the UI bundle. This configuration orchestrates this by starting multiple containers
simultaneously. Each container within this Compose configuration corresponds to a distinct
component or service of the development environment.

|===
| What (Container) | URL (host-port) | Info

| Website
| http://localhost:7888
| Antora-generated website with real contents (see xref:AUTO-GENERATED:Dockerfile.adoc[Dockerfile])

| UI Bundle Preview
| http://localhost:5252
| UI bundle preview for local development (see xref:AUTO-GENERATED:src/main/ui/material-admin-pro/ui-bundle/Dockerfile.adoc[src/main/ui/material-admin-pro/ui-bundle/Dockerfile])

| UI HTML Template
| http://localhost:5353
| Serve the static HTML template files which form the foundation of the UI bundle (and hence the whole website UI) through an Apache webserver

| Chef InSpec
| -
| Run Chef InSpec tests against the website container

| Loki
| -
| Loki is a log aggregation system designed to store and query logs from applications and infrastructure.

| Loki Promtail
| -
| Ship logfiles to loki

| Loki Grafana
| http://localhost:7000
| Visualize logfiles in dashboards
|===

The Grafana Loki configuration integrated into this Docker stack functions as a blueprint. This
setup collects logfiles from the apache serving the website. This blueprint can help with shipping
logs from instances running in both test and production stages to link:https://grafana.com/products/cloud[Grafana Cloud].

=== About Host Port and Container Port
It is important to note the distinction between `HOST_PORT` and `CONTAINER_PORT`. Networked
service-to-service communication uses the `CONTAINER_PORT`. When `HOST_PORT` is defined, the
service is accessible outside the compose stack as well.

=== Prerequisites

This compose config has been developed and tested with Docker version 24.0.2 on top of
Ubuntu 22.10.

== How to use

Make sure to control the image builds and containers by using the xref:AUTO-GENERATED:Makefile.adoc[Makefile].

The `make src/main/ui/material-admin-pro/ui-bundle/build/ui-bundle.zip` is a mandatory prerequisite
(which the Makefile ensures). Otherwise the build breaks due to a
missing UI bundle.
