= Dockerfile

Build and run the website.

== Overview

This Dockerfile is designed to simplify and streamline the build process of the
link:https://www.sommerfeld.io[www.sommerfeld.io] website by integrating and building its various
components. The main purpose of this Dockerfile is to generate the documentation sites using
link:https://www.antora.org[Antora].

== Prerequisites

This image has been developed and tested with Docker version 24.0.7 on top of Ubuntu 23.10.

== About the tags and versions

include::ROOT:partial$/docker-tag-strategy.adoc[]

=== How to use

Use `docker run --rm -p "7888:7888" sommerfeldio/website:rc` to run the moist recent release
candidate from DockerHub.

The most effective method to construct and operate the website on a local machine is by using
the xref:AUTO-GENERATED:Makefile.adoc[Makefile].

== Image Structure

This image is a multistage image, which means that the Dockerfile is structured to use multiple
stages during the build process. The multistage build feature helps to create more efficient and
smaller Docker images.

The `build-antora-site` stage handles the construction of the Antora UI bundle, serving as the
foundational component for building the actual website using Antora. Once the Antora UI bundle is
built, it can serve as the foundation upon which the actual website content is added. Antora
combines the content with the UI bundle to generate the final website, ensuring consistency in design
and layout throughout the site.

IMPORTANT: Make sure to control the image builds and containers by using the
xref:AUTO-GENERATED:Makefile.adoc[Makefile]. The
`make ui/material-admin-pro/ui-bundle/build/ui-bundle.zip` is a mandatory
prerequisite (which the Makefile ensures). Otherwise the build breaks due to a
missing UI bundle.

Once all pages are built, the `run` stage of the image initiates an HTTP server using the Docker
image link:https://hub.docker.com/_/httpd[httpd]. This HTTP server makes the entire website accessible
over HTTP. The resulting image from this stage only includes the built files needed for serving the
website, avoiding any unnecessary dependencies or intermediate build artifacts from previous stages.
This approach helps to create a more efficient and smaller Docker image, which is advantageous for
production deployment and distribution and reduces the surface for protential attacks.

To avoid running the image as `root`, the permissions of `/usr/local/apache2/logs` are changed to
allow `www-data` to write logs. Additionally the default http port is changed to `7888`, so keep
that in mind when mapping ports in a `+docker run ...+` command. This way the image can be used without
root permissions because the httpd server inside the container is started with the already existing
user `www-data`.

The webserver exposes his status information through http://localhost:7888/server-status.
