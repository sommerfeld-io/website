= Makefile

Build the website from its source files and run the website within a Docker container.

== Overview

This Makefile streamlines the process of building the website from its
source files and orchestrating its execution within Docker containers.

== How to use this Makefile

The default target, which is triggered when simply using `make` installs all dependencies,
builds the UI bundle and starts all Docker containers by invoking `make run`.

=== `make run`

Launches a Docker container based on the newly created image. The container is started in the
foreground. The locally hosted website can be accessed via a web browser at http://localhost:7888.

=== `make ui/material-admin-pro/ui-bundle/build/ui-bundle.zip`

Automates the process of building the Antora UI bundle. Use this target from a Github Actions
workflow to build the UI bundle from a pipeline.

=== `make clean`

Remove local Docker images, dependencies and build artifacts.

== Prerequisites

This Makefile needs Node, NPM and Gulp installed. To avoid having to install all
prerequisites on your host, open the project in the DevContainer from this repo. This project
has been developed in VSCode and tested with Docker version 24.0.7 on top of Ubuntu 23.10.
The xref:AUTO-GENERATED:-devcontainer/Dockerfile.adoc[DevContainer] for this repository ships
all these depencencies.
