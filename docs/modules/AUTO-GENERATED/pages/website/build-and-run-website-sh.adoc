= build-and-run-website.sh

Build a Docker image containing the whole link:https://www.sommerfeld.io[www.sommerfeld.io] website and run locally inside a Docker container.

== Overview

The script automates the process of creating a Docker image that encapsulates
the entire link:https://www.sommerfeld.io[sommerfeld-io website] within an Apache httpd web
server and launches it as a container for local testing. The website is built with Antora first.
This script simplifies the setup and configuration required to run the website locally. The
image is based on the official link:https://hub.docker.com/_/httpd[Apache httpd] image.

After the image is successfully built, the script launches a Docker container based on the
newly created image. The container is started in the foreground. The locally hosted website
can be accessed via a web browser at http://localhost:7888.

=== Script Arguments

The script does not accept any parameters.

== The webserver image

Per default, Apache httpd runs as `root` user because only root processes can listen to ports
below 1024. The default http port for web applications is 80. But this means the user inside the
container is `root` which poses a potential security risk. And since the webserver is running
inside a Docker container it is not important what port is used inside the container. So the http
port is changed to 7888 and the user is switched to the already present user `www-data`.

Apache is trying to write a file into `/usr/local/apache2/logs`, but the `www-data` user does
not have permission to create files in this directory. So permissions to this directory are
updated as well.

The image is intended for local testing purposes. For production use, take a look at the

Dockerhub.
