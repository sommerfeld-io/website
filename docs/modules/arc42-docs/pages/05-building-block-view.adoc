== Antora
This website is constructed using Antora, and all its pages originate from Asciidoc files.

link:https://antora.org[Antora] is a static site generator that simplifies the process of creating documentation websites. It takes content from link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest[Asciidoc] files, which are simple text documents formatted with a lightweight markup language, and turns them into a cohesive website.

These Asciidoc files aren't stored in a single place but rather exist across different repositories. All these repositories are part of the sommerfeld-io GitHub organization. That means that every repository can carry its own documentation. Antora is the tool that brings all this content together, formats it into a cohesive structure, and presents it as a unified documentation website for easy access and navigation.

This website uses link:https://kroki.io[Kroki] to generate diagrams from text sources. PlantUML is mostly used with this website, although other diagram types are supported as well.
