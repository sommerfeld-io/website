|Task |Desc |Example Tools
|Install |Install the software binaries and all dependencies |Bash, Chef, Puppet, Ansible
|Configure |Configure the software at runtime: e.g. configure port settings, file paths, users, leaders, followers, replication, etc. |Bash, Chef, Puppet, Ansible
|Provision |Provision the infrastructure: e.g. EC2 instances, load balancers, network topology, security groups, IAM, permissions, etc |Terraform, CloudFormation
|Deploy |Deploy the service on top of the infrastructure. Roll out updates with no downtime: e.g. blue-green, canary, rolling deployments |Scripts, Orchestration tools (ECSm k8s, Nomad)
|Security |Encryption in transit (TLS) and on disk, authentication, authorization, secrets management, server hardening |ACM, EBS Volumes, Cognito, Vault, CiS
|Monitoring |Availability metrics, business metrics, app metrics, server metrics, events, observability, tracing, alerting |CloudWatch, DataDog, New Relic, HoneyComb, Prometheus/Grafana
|Logs |Rotate logs on dist, aggregate log data to a central location |CloutWatch Logs, ELK, Sumo Logic, Papertrail, Prometheus/Grafana/Loki
|Backup + Restore |Make backups of DBs, caches and other data on a scheduled basis. Replicate to separate region / account |RDS, ElastiCache, ec2-snapper, Lambda
|Networking |VPCs, subnets, static and dynamic IPs, service discovery, service mesh, firewalls, DNS, SSH access, VPN access |...
|High Availability |Withstand outages of individual processes, EC2 instances, services, availability zones and regions |...
|Scalability |Scale up and down in response to load. Scale horizontally (more servers) and/or vertically (bigger servers) |...
|Performance |Optimize CPU, memory, disk, network, GPU and usage. Query tuning. Benchmarking, load testing, profiling |...
|Cost optimization |Pick proper instance types, use spit and reserved instances, use auto scaling, nuke unused resources |...
|Documentation |Document your code, architecture and practices. Create playbooks to respond to incidents |READMEs, wikis, Docs as Code
|Tests |Write automated tests for your infrastructure code. Run tests after every commit and nightly. |Terratest
